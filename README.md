# Amplify React GraphQL

Welcome to the Amplify React GraphQL repository! This repository is dedicated to my experiments with React and GraphQL, deployed using AWS Amplify. The project was initially deployed on AWS Free Tier for testing purposes.

## Overview

In this project, I explore the integration of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and GraphQL, a query language for APIs. By combining these technologies, I aim to create dynamic and interactive web applications. The project also includes deployment configurations for AWS Amplify, allowing seamless deployment of the application to the cloud.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs.
- AWS Amplify: A development platform for building scalable and secure cloud-powered applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sgunnell/amplify-react-graphql.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd amplify-react-graphql`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Deployment and Termination (Using AWS Free Tier)

This project was initially deployed on AWS Free Tier for testing purposes. Please note that resources deployed on AWS Free Tier have usage limits, and it's essential to monitor your usage to avoid additional charges.

- **Deployment:** The project can be deployed on AWS Amplify by pushing changes to the configured branch (e.g., `main`). Amplify will automatically build and deploy the application.

- **Termination:** After testing, make sure to terminate the resources on AWS Amplify to avoid incurring charges. You can do this through the AWS Management Console or Amplify CLI.
